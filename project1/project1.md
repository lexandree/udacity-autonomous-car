# Project 1 - Finding Lane Lines on the Road

The goal of this first project was to create a simple pipeline to detect road lines in a frame taken from a roof-mounted camera.

I was very impressed how a simple GUI tool can help to find right parameters.
A modified version with hough lines window is created:

The first run on video clip shows that an approximation approach is necessary. The next and final version with the class showed its effectiveness on all video clips.
