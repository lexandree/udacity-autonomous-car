# Project 1 - Finding Lane Lines on the Road

The goal of this first project was to create a simple pipeline to detect road lines in a frame taken from a roof-mounted camera.

I was very impressed how a simple GUI tool can help to find right parameters.
A modified version with hough lines window is created:

The first run on video clip shows that an approximation approach is necessary. The next and final version with the class showed its effectiveness on all video clips.

The jupyter notebook clones P1 template and creates all desired output images and video clips. It was run on Google Colab vm.
